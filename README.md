# cps-tests
This repo contains automatic tests for certain web app, which has a proprietary character. 

These are my first tests created using Selenium Webdriver and Java along with TestNG. 

This project has helped me to get more familiar with using git(e.g. branching), maven, testng, xpath selectors and so on. 

Approximate Project structure(there can be a slightly differences between class names present in repo and on the structure below).
